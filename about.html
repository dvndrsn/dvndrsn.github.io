<p>I am an engineer curious how data can be used to drive software development as well as people's decisions and
    perceptions of the world. </p>

<p>Currently at <a href="https://www.stridenyc.com/">Stride</a>, as a Software development consultant, I embed with
    existing teams in NYC and help them be better than we found them through application of non-dogmatic agile and
    technology best practices.</p>

<p>I'm a polygot at heart, but my current technical specialties include JavaScript (React, Redux, Apollo) and Python
    (Django, Graphine) with a special interest in developing Graphql API technologies. In the past, I've also spent time
    with Ruby and Java as well.</p>

<p>I'm also an avid technical communicator, a co host of a <a href="https://www.stridenyc.com/podcasts">weekly software
        engineering podcast</a>, and am always looking for more opportunities to write and speak about emerging
    technology.</p>

<p>I completed a session at <a href="https://www.recursecenter.com/">Recurse Center Retreat</a> as part of their Winter
    1 Batch. At Recurse, I focused on learning more about full-stack development and tools for data analysis.</p>

<p>Prior to Recurse, by day, I was a consultant and onsite team leader for a team of offshore developers. By night, I
    was (and still am) a <a href="https://modernairs.com">bassist</a>, traveler and dreamer.</p>
