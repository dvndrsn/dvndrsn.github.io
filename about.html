<p>I am an engineer curious how data can be used to drive software development as well as people's decisions and perceptions of the world. I recently completed a session at <a href="http://www.recursecenter.com/">Recurse Center Retreat</a> as part of their Winter 1 Batch.</p>

<p>At Recurse, I focused on learning more about full-stack development and tools for data analysis.</p>

<p>Prior to Recurse, by day, I was a consultant and onsite team leader for a team of offshore developers. By night, I was (and still am) a <a href="http://modernairs.com">bassist</a>, traveler and dreamer.</p>

<p>I'm currently looking for a job. You can find <a href="pdf/resume.pdf">my resume</a> here if you're curious to see more about me.</p>
