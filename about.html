<p>I am a data-curious (former) corporate codemonkey currently working through a fellowship at <a href="http://www.recursecenter.com/">Recurse Center</a> as part of the Winter 1 Batch.</p>

<p>At Recurse, I'm working to learn more about full-stack development and tools for data analysis.</p>

<p>Prior to Recurse, by day I was an onsite team leader for a team of offshore developers and by night I was (and still am) a <a href="http://modernairs.com">bassist</a>, traveler and dreamer.</p>
