Whoa yeah, blogging. How very 2000's!

I hadn't much considered writing a blog - technical or otherwise - until it was suggested by some colleagues at [Recurse Center][rc]. Going through [some][rc1] of their [awesome work][rc2] really [inspired me][rc3] and [reminded me][rc4] that I love blogs and that feeling that comes burning through a pile of articles in a finely curated [RSS feed reader][feedly]. I'm reminded specifically that I love blogs that:

* are informative [technically][tech] or [otherwise][non-tech].
* provide you with a [new perspective or appreciation][perspective] for the world around you.
* [amuse][haha], [entertain][entertainment] or fill you with [a sense of wonder][wonder].
* connect you with the [cultural movements][cultural], [trends][trend] or other [happenings][haps] in the internet or [places around you][places].

Hopefully this pile of words will do something along those lines while also helping to cement the knowledge that I'm working to gather and give back to the broader community.
